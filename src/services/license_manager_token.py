class LicenseManagerToken:
    """
    The thing is: license manager API is authenticated via JWT tokens, but
    those are - custom tokens: they do not follow JOSE standards. They require
    something like that: "ECC:p521_DSS_SHA:256" to be set to `alg` header, so
    neither PyJWT nor jwcrypto support such tokens (as far as I investigated).

    Example header

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "typ": "client-token",
            "alg": "ECC:p521_DSS_SHA:256",
            "kid": "f20e1939-7d37-48ad-a9eb-35db6723b013"
        }

    Example payload

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "customer": "EPAM Systems",
            "exp": 1707502018.614004
        }

    We do not require PyJWT lib for application, but jwcrypto is used, though
    not for this token.
    Another thing: initially these tokens were implemented simultaneously by
    one person both for Rule engine and for License Manager. Pycryptodome lib
    is used by LM and was used by Rule Engine (before this implementation).
    I did not like that 'cause we needed to bring Pycryptodome to lambda
    bundles and that lib is huge. Besides, we already had Cryptography as
    requirements. So, to sum up: LM uses Pycryptodome and to hell with that
    (maybe will be rewritten someday). But for Rule engine I removed
    Pycryptodome and use this custom token with Cryptography for signing.

    Currently, LM supports only one type of key-pairs: Elliptic Curve P-521,
    so don't burden myself with other implementations.
